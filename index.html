                        <p>Hi! I'm Hayden and I'm currently studying at RIT to become a Game Design major! This here is my website layout I've worked on, but I've worked on several other projects as well, such as projects in Unity and various other programming languages. I know how to code in C++, C#, and Java.</p>

                        <p>Here's some of my projects I've worked on! (Well, they're not here yet, but they will be probably)</p>
